Get Record Type Info by Object - Flow Action

This action can be used to generate a list of record types for a specific object. This can be useful when you would like to present a record type selector to the user. Can be used as inputs to the QuickChoice managed package by setting Input Mode to “Dual String Collections”. Pass in one output collection for Labels and one for the underlying values.
